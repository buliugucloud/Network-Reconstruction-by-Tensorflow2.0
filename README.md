# Network-Reconstruction-by-Tensorflow2.0
The repo to record some of my reconstruction work of classic network architectures using Tensorflow2.0. As I'm still a beginner, the chosen networks' structure is still relatively simple.
I'll share some related material in the files named by network, including related paper, network structure diagram, etc.
