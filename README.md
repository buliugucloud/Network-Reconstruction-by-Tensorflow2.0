# Network-Reconstruction-by-Tensorflow2.0
The repo to record some of my reconstruction work of classic network architectures using Tensorflow2.0. As I'm still a beginner, the chosen networks' structure is still relatively simple. In addition, I'll share some related material in the files named by network, including related paper, network structure diagram, etc.

**Attentionï¼š**
The file "d2l_tensorflow.py" contains some useful functions to help process data and training. It is imported from a python library--d2l. And some of my codes call the funstions that are implemented in this file.
